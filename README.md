## Update

This code has been updated with the changes explained in [my second part](https://youtu.be/v6KjuYYC78M). The previous code did not fully work for everyone. The new update should fix this behavior. So if you are confused I recommend to watch the second part.


## How To Use

Download and unzip the package. Inside the Unity Hub select "Add" and select this project folder.
